    <span>Researched, designed and programmed an autonomous line following robot. Robot uses infrared sensors to follow a dark line along a light background (or vice versa).</span> 
        
    <span> I started this project after completing an Intro to Engineering and Design course at Shoreline CC (ENGR104). </span>
    <span> In ENGR104, we built and programmed autonomous robots that manuevered around and avoided obstacles using a distance sensor.</span>
    <span> ENGR104 and it's prereq were my first exposure to both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. </span>
    <span> I remember being fascinated with how sensors allow a robot to interact with it's environment. </span>
     <span> When the course was finished, I wanted to improve my robot and continue working with sensors. I spoke with my instructor and he gave me a few project ideas. I decided I wanted to make my robot follow lines on the ground. </span>
