    <p> Health information is critical to a person’s wellbeing and overall quality of life. With the pandemic still ongoing, and medical issues 
        still a large part of everyone's lives, the ability to access personal medical information and communicate with health care providers remotely is a great benefit. 
        While anyone will be able to use and benefit from the Home Health Station, those with pre-existing conditions will benefit most
         from the more consistent monitoring of their health from the safety of their home.</p>
    <p>Placed in an easily accessible, elevated to waist height position in the user’s home, the station operates in either an off state, 
        or a low power state that the user can manage from the push of a button.
         When that button is pressed, the user can choose either of the two tests our station provides at the time, 
         a heart rate sensor and an EMG test. After choosing the test they would like to take, and placing themselves in the proper position to 
         take the test, each test takes about 15 seconds to get a number. During that time, the user is able to see what test they 
         are taking on our LCD display. After the test has been completed, the user will choose whether or not to send that data 
         to our database and website. The data is sent as a message. A message includes the fields (columns) and the corresponding data values 
         to the respective fields. Also a bulk update of data (fields with multiple data values) can also be sent in one message. 
         After the data is retrieved from the database, the users can see the test record after login on to our website. 
         The users can also delete each test result or all the tests at once.
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of our website is to create an interface where users can securely view and manage their test results. 
        Our website has register and login functionality, giving users secure access to their personal account. 
        When you visit our website you will see a homepage that greets you as a guest user. 
        It will prompt you to either sign up or login to your account. 
        We also have an About page set up, to gather all information about this project. 
        This is where you will find progress updates, a link to our software repository, information about the team, 
        and a link to send an email to the team. </p>
    <p>After users login, they will see a customized home page. 
        We have some resources displayed on the user home page including various health centers in the Seattle area. 
        Users can view their profile page where they can edit their profile information such as username, email, DOB etc. 
        This is also where users can view their test results. By clicking the “New Pulse Test“ button, user’s can request the most recent 
        Pulse test result associated with their account. If there is a new test result ready in the ThingSpeak database,
         a test result summary will be printed to the user profile page every time this button is clicked.
          If there is no new test result data, a message is printed to inform the user. Each test summary contains a delete me button 
          and a button to view the entire test result. When users expand the test result they will see their pulse data displayed in either 
          green, yellow or red. Users can delete all of their test results at once from the profile page. 
          We also provide a page where users can view visualizations of their Pulse test results. 
          EMG test results and visualizations are displayed on a separate page.

<span> I worked on this project with a group of 5 other students for our Embedded Systems Capstone course. <br><br>
    I was the software development manager for this project. I designed and developed a user interface where users can securely login to their account and view their test results. 
    <br><br>I established communication between the backend of our Flask website and the database where we store sensor data. 
    <br><br>I connected sensor data to user accounts by establishing a SQLite database of users, and linking packets of sensor data to users in the database. </span>
Developed with: <br> 

<ul>
    <li>Python Flask</li>
    <li>Jinja2 and HTML, CSS, JS</li>
    <li>Hosted on Heroku</li>
</ul>
<p> The backend of our website grabs sensor data from our ThingSpeak database and links that data to user accounts in our SQLite database. 
    Processed sensor data is stored in our database of users in a packets table. 
    A packet represents the results of a single test the user has taken.
     Every packet is linked to a user in our database through the user’s unique id. 
     In order to manage packets, each packet also contains a unique identifier.
