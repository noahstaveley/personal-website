    <span>Introduces the implementation of digital logic and its specification and simulation.
        Covers Boolean algebra; combinational circuits including arithmetic circuits and regular structures;
        sequential circuits including finitestate-machines; and use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
        Emphasizes simulation, high-level specification, and automatic synthesis techniques. </span>
