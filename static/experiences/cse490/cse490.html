    <span>We live in a world completely permeated by the internet and the web.
         It's time to think of the web browser as a critical piece of systems infrastructure, alongside compilers and operating systems. 
         While industrial strength browsers are massive and complex systems with many features, 
         the basic structure of a browser can be expressed in just a thousand lines of code. 
         In this class we will study browser internals and build our own web browsers from scratch. 
         By the end of the first week, you will have a working "browser" that does nothing more than download the webpage 
         and print it as text to the console. From there, each week we will extend the browser with a new feature. 
         By the end of the quarter, you will have your own graphical browser supporting text layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for building interactive pages.
        Weekly assignments will primarily involve implementing features in your browser. 
        Previous experience with web technologies is not required. </span>
