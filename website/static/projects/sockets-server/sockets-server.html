        <b>Project 1 </b> - Java<br> <br>
    
        I created a client application that communicates with a server over UDP and TCP sockets using a specified communication protocol.
        The client's task is to follow the protocol as closely as possible and to extract a secret from the server for each stage of the protocol. 
        The server's task is to validate that the client is following the protocol. 
        The server will send a response to only valid clients 
        -- any deviation of the client from the protocol causes the server to close the connection.
        
        The server can handle multiple clients at a time.

        <b>Project 2 </b>- Python <br> <br>

        Objective: Learn about Software Defined Networking by building simple networks using SDN primitives and OpenFlow Protocol. <br> <br>

        I used mininet - an SDN-enabled network emulator. As well as POX - research/academic implementation of an OpenVFlow controller. <br>

        <br><b>Project 3 </b>- Python <br> <br>

       Objective: Use Mininet to study the bufferbloat phenomenon. <br> 

            - Learn the first-hand dynamics of TCP sawtooth and router buffer occupancy in a network <br>
            - Learn why large router buffers can lead to poor performance <br>
            - Learn the difference between TCP Reno and TCP BBR and how their performance compares <br>
            - Use Mininet to create network topologies, run traffic generators, and collect and plot statistics <br>
            - Practice packaging experiements so it's easy for others to run my code <br> <br>


        This project helped me gain a better understanding of the dynamics of TCP in home networks. In a typical home network, 
        a Home Router is connected via a Cable or DSL to a Headend router at the Internet access provider's office (see figure on the second slide to the left) <br>
        I emulated this simple home network with Mininet and measured cwnd and buffer occupancy as data was downloaded from a remote server to the end host.
