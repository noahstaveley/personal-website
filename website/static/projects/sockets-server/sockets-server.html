        I created a client application that communicates with a server over UDP and TCP sockets using a specified communication protocol.
        The client's task is to follow the protocol as closely as possible and to extract a secret from the server for each stage of the protocol. 
        The server's task is to validate that the client is following the protocol. 
        The server will send a response to only valid clients 
        -- any deviation of the client from the protocol causes the server to close the connection.
        
        The server can handle multiple clients at a time.
