    Project Nearly Complete <br> <br>

    <span> I worked on this project with a group of 4 other students for our Embedded Systems Capstone course. <br><br>
        I was the software development manager for this project. I designed and developed a user interface where users can securely login to their account and view their test results. 
        <br><br>I established communication between the backend of our Flask website and the database where we store sensor data. 
        <br><br>I connected sensor data to user accounts by establishing a SQLite database of users, and linking packets of sensor data to users in the database. </span>
